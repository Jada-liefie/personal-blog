		 <h2> MY OWN PERSONAL BLOG ABOUT MYSELF </h2> 
		 <p> 
		  
		  My name is Jada Smith. I currently attend Westville High School, I am 14 years, I have an older brother, I am a Jehovah Witness and I love working with computers.

I attended Triomf Primary School from grade R -grade 7 and I had the best years of my life at Triomf Primary School. I had amazing friends that I will never forget and they will always have a place in my heart. Through my years at Triomf Primary School my best year was grade 7. That was my favorite because I went on my Grade 7 camp which was amazing .

</p>
<p>
We went to Jefferys Bay and we did so much  activities and had so much fun. We played Volley ball at the beach and had a sand castle competition ( childish I know but it was super fun).I also enjoyed grade 7 the most because we had a market day ,where the grade 7 learners sold cupcakes and things of our choice to the school and we could keep the money.We also had a day where all the grade 7 learners wrote on each others T-shirts to remember each other by and it was so much fun.
</p>
<p>
The year then ended and it was time to go to High School. I was not that excited because  all my friends went to other schools and I was the only one in my friend group that went to Westville High School. It was time  to make new friends ,which I am great at doing because I am a very social person. I made new friends and today we are very close.
</p>
<p>
My first year at High School was tough because I had to adjust to new teachers and the finding my way around the school and getting to know new teachers.It was tough but I eventually figured out  my way around the school  and where all the teachers classes were with my brothers help. The teachers we all friendly and strict when they needed to be.
</p>
<p>
I personally loved all my teachers especially my English and Mathematics teachers , and because of them Mathematics and English is my favorite subjects.
</p>
<p>
My first year at High School went by so quickly and the next moment I realized it was the December Holidays and the following year I would be in grade 9.
</p>
<p>
I enjoyed my Holiday very much because my cousin visited me from Johannesburg , that I missed so much and he was litterly here for the entire holiday and it was just amazing to have him here.
</p>
<p>
But then it was time to go back to school and start grade 9 , I was super nervous because everyone told me that Grade 9 was really difficult and that I should study really hard. I completed my first term of Grade 9 and it was super easy for me. The holiday came ,even though it was short I was excited for it. The holiday ended and it was time to start term 2.
</p>
<p>
I was excited going into term 2 because I enjoyed  term 1. Term 2 went by really quickly ,it was almost in an eye blink term 2 ended and it was the June holidays. I was really excited for the June holidays because I mean what child doesnâ€™t love the June holiday,but even the June holiday went by really quickly and it was time for term 3.
</p>
<p>
Term 3 was when everything happened. I was invited to a coding course at Vodacom along with 6 other girls at Westville High School. I was extremely happy because I never thought in a million years that I would be given this opportunity (I was sad because it took my whole holiday to do that course)
</p>
<p>
I went to Vodacom and created my own website and I instantly fell inlove with crating websites and using computers. ( https://jada-liefie.github.io/why-I-am-grateful-for-my-parents.html/) check it out if you want lol.
